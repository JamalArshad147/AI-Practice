## 1. To Create "Another" Environment (with a New Name)

This is the best option if you want to keep your old env_ai and create a second, new, identical one.

Run this command in your Bash terminal: 'conda env create -f environment.yml -n my_new_env'

    conda env create: The command to create a new environment.

    -f environment.yml: Specifies which file to use as the blueprint.

    -n my_new_env: Gives the new environment a different name (you can change my_new_env to anything you want).


Note: 

you must run that command in the same directory where your environment.yml file is saved.

The command conda env create -f environment.yml looks for the .yml file in the directory you are currently in.

If you are not in the correct directory, you can either:

    Navigate to it first (e.g., cd path\to\your\directory).

    Provide the full path in the command (e.g., conda env create -f C:\Users\Jamal\Downloads\environment.yml).
